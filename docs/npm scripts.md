The following npm scripts are available, for information on what gulp tasks do, please refer to the {@link build.tasks} documentation.
You don't need to have gulp installed globally for these to work, as they use the local gulp executable.

 - dev - runs the {@link build.tasks.dev} gulp task
 - build - runs the {@link build.tasks.build:prod} gulp task
 - test - runs the {@link build.tasks.test} gulp task
 - ci - runs the {@link build.tasks.test:ci} gulp task
